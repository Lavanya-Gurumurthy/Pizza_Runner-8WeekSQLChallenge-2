# Pizza_Runner-8WeekSQLChallenge-2
This is my solution for Case Study 2 - Pizza Runner of Danny Ma's #8WeekSQLChallenge

Danny was looking to expand his new Pizza empire and he has decided to uberize it. For this, he had hired several runners who would pick the pizzas from the HQ and deliver it to the customers. Danny has some data and wants to analyze them so that he could use some insights to develop the pizza business. 

Please find the link to the case study below, where you can find all information - the data-the tables and the design and also the questions for the case study or the problems that Danny looks to solve.

There are several questions which required usage of many new functions and approach to solve.
I have used Postgres to solve the challenges. I have attached the SQL queries for the different tasks herewith and also the answers or results in a text document.

The entire exercise required a good data cleaning as the data had some issues - improper variable type, inconsistent values, erroneous values, etc.
While we do have CAST function, which help a lot in modifying the datatype just during the query run, without actually having to change the datatype, in some cases updating the datatype helped in subsequent usage of the fields and values.

Check out the SQL codes and also the solution document if you are interested.
